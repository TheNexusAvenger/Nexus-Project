# Contributing
Bugs and requests can be made through issues. Pull requests are
open, but will only be accepted if they have the following:
<br>1. A reason to be pulled.
<br>2. Follow the existing coding standards (tabs, PascalCase, etc).

<br>4. Comments are included.

## Pulling Into Studio
The format of this repository is based on [Rojo by LPGhatguy](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo).
Any other tools that follow the same file structure will work.

## Exporting From Studio
No public tool is currently provided for exporting Rojo
projects from Roblox Studio. "Nexus Project Syncer" currently
exists as an internal tool but will require significant work
done before it can be released. The end goal of that project
will be to replace Rojo while still being compatible. This
functionality is expected to be added to Rojo in the near
future.
